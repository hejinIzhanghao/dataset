This is a publicly available benchmark dataset for testing and evaluating novel and state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms. Several researchers and students have requested a benchmark of non-visible (e.g., infrared) images and videos. The benchmark contains videos and images recorded in and beyond the visible spectrum and is available for free to all researchers in the international computer vision communities.
